                <h1>The Burning</h1>
                <h2>Chelsea Jayne Jamorabon</h2>
                <p>The Burning was inspired by Gabriel Picolo's comic book titled "Icarus and the Sun," which was 
                    based on the famous Greek myth of Daedalus and Icarus, about a son who flew too close to the sun.
                    <br><br>
                    The story behind this painting is about the forbidden love that was never meant to be from the start 
                    due to the conflict or, better yet, differences between the two people. In this case, when the two 
                    lovers finally shared their last kiss, the human male melted while the sun-male cried as his lover had passed.A devastating end.
                    <br><br>                    
                    The reasoning behind this painting all comes down to the conflict between LGBTQ+ people being deemed 
                    immoral throughout history and being forbidden. People argue that the two won't work out together, hence 
                    the association with fire and wax. Yet even when society places that rule unknowingly, it doesn't stop 
                    he beauty of a candle being lit as a symbol of hope and warmth between two people, regardless of their 
                    gender and such.
