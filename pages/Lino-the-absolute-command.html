                    My artwork depicts a non-binary person who is anxious and a hand nearly grabbing her 
                    represents how it will control her every move and their everything. The Absolute command 
                    is about how society controls the people base off  two genders. In a stereotypical way, 
                    If you’re a girl, you can only wear dresses, play with dolls, do cooking and only hang 
                    out with girls. While if you’re a boy you should only play, cars, cards and play with boys. 
                    <br><br>
                    A lot of children learned from this stage to separate themselves, even though it’s just toys.
                    As a child back then, I experienced most of this things. It implemented me into thinking that 
                    I should forbid myself to enjoy something just because the opposite gender enjoys it.  But that 
                    shouldn’t be the case, if a child likes something, you should let them play with it. Don’t let toys, 
                    be the one to hesitate them to enjoy what they like. 
                    <br><br>
                    The hand represents society and how much it controls us, just to fit in. I wanted it to be reflected 
                    how reality a modern society is and incorporated it to my art. Since most of the people I see, 
                    struggle from keeping up with an image. The non-binary of my piece represents the LGBTQ+ community 
                    because they are mostly the ones who struggle from this, and that shouldn’t be the case. They should 
                    be free on showing who they want to be, hangout with people they want to be, and wear what they want to be.
